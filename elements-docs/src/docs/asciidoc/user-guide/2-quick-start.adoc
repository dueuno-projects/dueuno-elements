== Quick Start

=== Basics

To develop _Dueuno Elements_ applications you need to learn the basics of the https://groovy-lang.org/[Apache Groovy,window=_blank] programming language and the basics of the https://grails.org/[Grails framework,window=_blank].

==== Learning Groovy
The Groovy programming language has been around for more than 20 years now, it's been the second language to be developed for the JVM. You can https://groovy-lang.org/documentation.html[read the documentation,window=_blank] and access the https://groovy-lang.org/learn.html[Groovy learning resources,window=_blank]

==== Learning Grails
Grails has been helping web developers for 20 years now, it still is a growing and evolving technology so what you want to do is https://grails.org/documentation.html[reading the latest documentation on the Grails website,window=_blank]

=== Run
We are going to create our first _Dueuno Elements_ application, ready?

. Download and install https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/[IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition,window=_blank].

. Download the https://dueuno.com/dueuno-app-template.zip[Application Template,window=_blank]
.. Unzip it into your home directory
.. Open it with IntelliJ IDEA
.. Run the application from the Gradle sidebar clicking on `project-name -> Tasks -> application -> bootRun`

[source,bash,background-color="black",subs="attributes,normal"]

... finished configuring Spring Security Core

Grails application running at https://localhost:8080[window=_blank] in environment: development
----

NOTE: The first run will take some time since it has to download all the needed dependencies.

We can now navigate to https://localhost:8080[window=_blank] to see the login screen. Login with the credentials `*super/super*` to play around with the basic features of a plain _Dueuno Elements_ application.
