== Basics

In _dueuno:elements_ everything is a component. All visual objects of the application are derived from the same base class _Component_ and they can be assembled together like we do with a LEGO set.

Some of these components are automatically created and managed by _dueuno:elements_ for each application instance. Let's give them a quick look.

=== The Shell

We call _Shell_ the _dueuno:elements_ GUI. Each _dueuno:elements_ application share a common user experience and content structure.

==== Login

Where you can log in.

==== Navigation Bar

The user can access (from left to right) (1) the Main Menu, (2) the Home - where users can find their favourite features - and (3) the User Menu.

==== Content

Each Feature will display as an interactive screen we call _Content_ that will occupy the main area surrounded by the Shell.

Contents can be displayed as modals. A modal content is rendered inside a dialog window. This lets the user focus on a specific part of the Feature to accomplish subtasks like editing a specific object.

Modals can be displayed in three sizes: `normal` (default), `wide` and `fullscreen`.

==== User Messages

The application can display messages to the user to send alerts or confirm actions.

==== Responsiveness

All _dueuno:elements_ applications work both on desktop computers and on mobile devices by design and without the developer having to cope with it. Here is how an application looks like on a Desktop, on a Tablet and on a Mobile Phone.

=== Project Structure
_dueuno:elements_ applications are Grails applications. The project structure, follows the _conventions over configuration_ design paradigm so each folder contains specific source file types.

==== Filesystem

----
/myapp                      <1>

  /grails-app               <2>
    /controllers            <3>
    /services               <4>
    /domain                 <5>
    /i18n                   <6>
    /init                   <7>
    /conf                   <8>

  /src
    /main
      /groovy              <9>
----
<1> Project root
<2> Web Application root
<3> User Interface. Each class name under this directory must end with `Controller` (Eg. `PersonController`)
<4> Business Logic. Each class name under this directory must end with `Service` (Eg. `PersonService`)
<5> Database. Each class name under this directory must begin with `T` (Eg. `TPerson`)
<6> Translations
<7> Initialization
<8> Configuration files
<9> Other application source files

Each folder contains the package structure, so for example if your application main package is `myapp` the source file structure will look like this:

----
/myapp
  /grails-app

    /controllers
      /myapp
        MyController.groovy

    /services
      /myapp
        MyService.groovy

    /domain
      /myapp
        MyDomainClass.groovy

    /init
      /myapp
        BootStrap.groovy

  /src
    /main
      /groovy
        /myapp
          MyClass.groovy
----

==== Features

A _dueuno:elements_ application is a set of _Features_.

Each Feature consists of a set of visual objects the user can interact with to accomplish specific tasks. You can identify each Feature as an item in the application menu on the left. Clicking a menu item will display the content of the selected Feature.

To configure the application Features we register them in the `BootStrap.groovy` file (See <<registerFeature>>):

./grails-app/init/BootStrap.groovy
[source, groovy]
----
class BootStrap {

    ApplicationService applicationService // <1>

    def init = { servletContext ->

        applicationService.init { // <2>
            registerFeature( // <3>
                    controller: 'person',
                    icon: 'fa-user',
            )
        }

    }
}
----
<1> `ApplicationService` is the object in charge of the application setup
<2> The `init = { servletContext -> ... }` Grails closure is executed each time the application starts up
<3> Within the `applicationService.init { ... }` closure you can call any of the `applicationService` methods. In this case the method `registerFeature()`

==== Controllers

A _Feature_ links to a _controller_.

A _controller_ is a set of _actions_.

All _actions_ that a user can take on the application (eg. a click on a button) are coded as methods of a _controller_. Each action corresponds to a URL that will be submitted from the browser to the server. The URL follows this structure:

----
http://my.company.com/${controllerName}/${actionName}
----

For example the following Controller contains two actions that can be called like this:

----
http://my.company.com/person/index <1>
http://my.company.com/person/edit/1 <2>
----

[source, groovy]
./grails-app/controllers/PersonController.groovy
----
class PersonController implements ElementsController {

    def index() { // <1>
        dispaly ...
    }

    def edit() {  // <2>
        display ... //<3>
    }

}
----
<1> The `index` action. It's the default one, it can also be called omitting the action name, eg. `http://my.company.com/person`
<2> The `edit` action
<3> The `display` method ends each action and tells the browser what component to display

==== Services
We don't implement business logic in Controllers. We do it in _Services_. Each Service is a class implementing several methods we can call from a Controller.

For example the following Service implements the method `sayHello()`.

[source, groovy]
./grails-app/services/PersonService.groovy
----
class PersonService {

    String sayHello() {
        return "Hi folks!"
    }

}
----

We can call it from a Controller like this:

[source, groovy]
./grails-app/controllers/PersonController.groovy
----
class PersonController implements ElementsController {

    PersonService personService // <1>

    def index() {
        def hello = personService.sayHello()
        display message: hello // <2>
    }

}
----
<1> Service injection, the variable name must be the _camelCase_ version of the _PascalCase_ class name
<2> the `display` method renders objects on the browser, in this case a message

==== Database

Each application has a `DEFAULT` database connection defined in the `grails-app/conf/application.yml` file. This `DEFAULT` connection cannot be changed at runtime and it is used by _dueuno:elements_ to store its own database.

. You can configure multiple databases per environment (DEV, TEST, PRODUCTION, ect) in the `application.yml`, see: https://docs.grails.org/latest/guide/single.html#environments

. You can edit/create database connections at runtime from the _dueuno:elements_ GUI accessing with the `super` user from the menu `System Configuration -> Connection Sources`

. You can programmatically create database connections at runtime with the `ConnectionSourceService` as follows:

./grails-app/init/BootStrap.groovy
[source, groovy]
----
class BootStrap {

    ApplicationService applicationService // <1>
    ConnectionSourceService connectionSourceService // <2>

    def init = { servletContext ->

        applicationService.onInstall { String tenantId -> // <3>
            connectionSourceService.create( // <4>
                    name: 'runtimeDatasource',
                    driverClassName: 'org.h2.Driver',
                    dbCreate: 'update',
                    username: 'sa',
                    password: '',
                    url: 'jdbc:h2:mem:DYNAMIC_CONNECTION;LOCK_TIMEOUT=10000 DB_CLOSE_ON_EXIT=TRUE',
            )
        }
    }

}
----
<1> `ApplicationService` is the object in charge of the application setup
<2> `ConnectionSourceService` service injection
<3> The `onInstall { ... }` closure is called only the first time the application runs for the DEFAULT Tenant and each time a new Tenant is created
<4> The `create()` method creates a new connection and connects to it. Once created the application will automatically connect to it each time it boots up. Connection details can be changed via GUI accessing as `super` from the menu `System Configuration -> Connection Sources`

==== Tenants

_Multi-Tenants_ applications share the code while connecting to different databases, usually one for each different company. This way data is kept separated with no risk of disclosing data from one company to the other.

Each application user can only belong to one Tenant. If a person needs to access different Tenants two different accounts must be created. To configure and manage users for a Tenant you have to access the application as the admin user. For each Tenant a default admin user is created with the same name as the Tenant (E.g. the Tenant called 'TEST' is going to have a 'test' user which is the Tenant administrator.

NOTE: The default password for such users corresponds to their names. To change the password you need to log in with the admin user and change it from the `User Profile`. Go to `User Menu (top right) -> Profile`.

New Tenants can be created from the _dueuno:elements_ GUI accessing as `super` from the menu `System Configuration -> Tenants`. If multi-tenancy is not a requirement to your application you will be using the `DEFAULT` Tenant which is automatically created.

==== User Management

Users can access a _dueuno:elements_ application with credentials made of a username and a secret password. Each user must be configured by the Tenant's `admin` user from the menu `System Administration -> Users` and `System Administration -> Groups`.
