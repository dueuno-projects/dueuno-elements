== Application Basics

I love _Philosophy_. I could write thousands of words about Dueuno Elements but there’s another thing I love: *Practice*.

So let’s write our first Dueuno Elements application, shall we?

NOTE: If you are a seasoned developer, or you’re in a hurry, install https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/?er=221886#java{version-java}[Java {version-java}, window=_blank], go download the https://github.com/dueuno-projects/dueuno-app-template[Dueuno Elements Template Application, window=_blank], run it with `./gradlew bootRun` and these are your three steps.

=== Grails

Dueuno Elements is built on top of the Grails Framework. The Grails website gives us what we need to quickly start up with a _“blank”_ application project.

. https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/?er=221886#java{version-java}[Download and install Java {version-java}, window=_blank]
. Go here: https://start.grails.org[https://start.grails.org, window=_blank]
. *Select “Java {version-java}” — SELECT JAVA {version-java} (We only support Grails {version-grails} with Java {version-java}.*
. Click _“Generate Project”_
. Download the `demo.zip` file and uncompress it on your home folder

=== Dueuno Elements

Find the `dependencies` section of the `build.gradle` file and add the following line:

.~/demo/build.gradle
[source,groovy,subs="attributes+"]
----
...

dependencies {
...

    implementation 'org.dueuno:elements-core:{revnumber}'
}
----

Copy the following code in `BootStrap.groovy`:

.~/demo/grails-app/init/BootStrap.groovy
[source,groovy,subs="attributes+"]
----
package com.example

import dueuno.elements.core.ApplicationService

class BootStrap {

    ApplicationService applicationService

    def init = { servletContext ->
        applicationService.init {
            // It's fine to leave this empty at the moment
        }
    }

    def destroy = {
    }
}
----

Delete `~/demo/grails-app/controllers/UrlMappings.groovy`

=== First Execution

.Execute the application
[source,console,subs="attributes+"]
----
$ ./gradlew bootRun
----

TIP: The first time you run the application a lot of dependencies will be downloaded so go get something to drink or play Tetris. I love playing Tetris.

Open the displayed URL: `http://localhost:8080[http://localhost:8080, window=_blank]`

With a bit of luck, at this point you should be able to see something on the screen. You can login with the following `username/password`:

- `super/super` +
This is the _Superuser_, it has full power on the system. You can create new tenants, configure the system properties and monitor the whole application.

- `admin/admin` +
This is the _DEFAULT Tenant Administrator_. It can configure the tenant properties, manage groups, users and watch audit logs.

We can now play around with the basics of a Dueuno Elements application. When done, we can terminate the application pressing `CTRL + C`.
