Dueuno Elements
===
[Dueuno Elements](https://dueuno.com) lets you build backoffice web applications in days instead of months with a single programming language: [Apache Groovy](https://groovy-lang.org).

The main goal is to strongly decouple the Business Logic from the GUI rising the abstraction level to a point where we don't need to know HTML, CSS and JavaScript to build CRUDs & common UIs.

Dueuno Elements is built on top of the [Grails Framework](https://grails.org) and its [Conventions over Configuration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convention_over_configuration) paradigm to lower the cost of onboarding new developers, build projects faster and keep them updated easier.

Work is ongoing to support the [Grace Framework](https://graceframework.org/) as well.
