Dueuno Elements
===
> Do you know? The name `Dueuno` is made up of two italian words: `due` which means two, and `uno` which means one. It represents two teams playing together to achieve the same goal.

[Dueuno Elements](https://dueuno.org) is a framework built on top of the [Grails Framework](https://grails.org) to build Backoffice web applications (aka Internal Tools) with a single programming language: the amazing [Apache Groovy](https://groovy-lang.org).

The main goal is to strongly decouple the Business Logic from the GUI rising the abstraction level to a point where we don't need to know HTML, CSS, JavaScript to build CRUDs & common UIs.

We rely on the beautiful [Grails Framework](https://grails.org) and its [Conventions over Configuration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convention_over_configuration#:~:text=Convention%20over%20configuration%20(also%20known,repeat%20yourself%20(DRY)%20principles.) paradigm to lower the cost of  new developers onboarding, build projects faster and keep them organized.

Work is ongoing to support [Grace Framework](https://graceframework.org/) as well.
